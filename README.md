recursive-transcode
===================

Recursively transcode files to H264. Find movies that are not H264 and transcode them.
Created this script for use with Plex and Amazon Fire TV Stick which only supports the H264 / AAC Codec.

The script checks the extension, file size is large than X, and finally that the codec is not already H264.
